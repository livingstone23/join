Hi bud! I built this .NET 10 blueprint to share how I apply Clean Architecture, SOLID, and DDD in real-world systems. It’s a production-ready reference featuring CQRS, RabbitMQ, and Redis. My goal is to help the community bridge the gap between theory and high-performance practice. Built with 15+ years of Lead expertise. Let's grow together!
